In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Input Format: The description list is provided in JSON format. Each JSON object (representing a single description) appears on a new line within the `Description List` section.\n2. Output Format: The merged description will be returned as plain text, presented in multiple paragraphs, without any additional formatting or extraneous comments before or after the summary.\n3. Comprehensiveness: The summary must integrate all key information from *every* provided description. Do not omit any important facts or details.\n4. Context: Ensure the summary is written from an objective, third-person perspective; explicitly mention the name of the entity or relation for full clarity and context.\n5. Context & Objectivity:\n  - Write the summary from an objective, third-person perspective.\n  - Explicitly mention the full name of the entity or relation at the beginning of the summary to ensure immediate clarity and context.\n6. Conflict Handling:\n  - In cases of conflicting or inconsistent descriptions, first determine if these conflicts arise from multiple, distinct entities or relationships that share the same name.\n  - If distinct entities/relations are identified, summarize each one *separately* within the overall output.\n  - If conflicts within a single entity/relation (e.g., historical discrepancies) exist, attempt to reconcile them or present both viewpoints with noted uncertainty.\n7. Length Constraint:The summary's total length must not exceed 600 tokens, while still maintaining depth and completeness.\n8. Language: The entire output must be written in English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) may in their original language if proper translation is not available.\n  - The entire output must be written in English.\n  - Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n---Input---\nEntity Name: Màn Hình\n\nDescription List:\n\n```\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to a screen where various actions, such as zooming, are performed.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình is the screen referred to where the user can zoom in and out to see details.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to a screen or display that is being interacted with in the context provided.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to the screen on which the action is being performed.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to the display screen where the zoom position is being adjusted.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to the screen where user interactions take place, and information is displayed.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to the display screen where the zoom position is being adjusted.\"}\n{\"Description\": \"Màn Hình refers to the screen where user interactions take place, and information is displayed.\"}\n```\n\n---Output---",

    "return": "Users can zoom in and zoom out on their screens to adjust the visibility of information. This is typically achieved through specific keyboard and mouse actions. Here's how it works:\n\n### Zooming In and Out\n\n- **Zoom In**: To magnify the display, users can press the **Ctrl** key on their keyboard in combination with a mouse action, specifically by using the mouse wheel or clicking with the mouse. For example, the action is often described as:\n  - Pressing the **Ctrl** key and scrolling the mouse wheel upwards.\n  - Alternatively, users can click and drag a mouse to focus on a specific area.\n\n- **Zoom Out**: To reduce the magnification and see a broader perspective, users again use the **Ctrl** key in conjunction with mouse actions. The method typically employed includes:\n  - Pressing the **Ctrl** key and scrolling the mouse wheel downwards.\n  - Another noted action is clicking and dragging the mouse downwards (referred to as \"Ln chut xuöng\") to achieve the zoom-out effect.\n\n### User Interaction\n\nThe user (referred to as **Nguòi Dung**) interacts with the screen (or **Màn Hình**) while performing these zoom functions to improve the visibility of detailed information when needed, or to get an overview of the content being displayed. \n\nThere are also multiple methods of executing these zoom actions, such as using specific commands or settings available in the application's interface.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, through a combination of the **Ctrl** key and mouse actions, users can effectively manage their viewing experience by zooming in or out on various types of content displayed on their screens.\n\n### References\n\n- [1] /Users/hoangleduc/Desktop/Coding Project/ragapi/uploads/393da2b1-4423-478b-8216-c86f3d6753af/first5sheets_auto.pdf",
